# Wocabee Bot

It only works on practice mode for 2 WocaPoints, but it's still alright i guess...

I only tested it in Firefox and Chrome, but it should work in other browsers.

## Installation

Chrome - download [User JavaScript and CSS extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld), go to [Wocabee](https://wocabee.app/), click on the extension and then on Add new button. Copy and paste the code from code.js file to the JS text area, click on Save, and then close the tab.

Firefox - download [javascript extenstion](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript/), go to [Wocabee](https://wocabee.app/), click on the extension, copy and paste the code from code.js file into the window, and then reload the page.

## Usage

When you go to [Wocabee App](https://wocabee.app/app/), you should see some buttons at the top.

The Start button starts the bot (be in practice section, and in 2 WocaPoints section), to stop the bot, just click on Save and leave.

The Log button logs all of the vocabulary into the console.

The hide button hides the buttons.
