# Wocabee Bot

I've only tested it in Firefox and Chrome, but it should work in other browsers.

## Installation

Chrome - download [User JavaScript and CSS extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nbhcbdghjpllgmfilhnhkllmkecfmpld), go to [Wocabee](https://wocabee.app/), click on the extension and then on Add new button. Copy and paste the code from code.js file to the JS text area, click on Save, and then close the tab.

Firefox - download [javascript addon](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/javascript/), go to [Wocabee](https://wocabee.app/), click on the extension, copy and paste the code from code.js file into the window, and then reload the page.

## Usage

When you go to [Wocabee App](https://wocabee.app/app/), and select some package to do, there should (hopefully) be some buttons up top.

- **Auto Translate** - toggleable button that so far works only on 2 WocaPoints mode, it just submits the correct answer every 5 seconds.
- **Auto Focus** - toggleable button that automatically focuses the answer box, so instead of needing to click it, you can type right away (not necessary, just some QOL)
- **Translate Current Word** - button that tries to show / input the correct answer (without submitting it)
- **Log Table** - logs a simple table with translations to the console
- **Log JSON** - logs the translations, but in a json format
- **Hide** - hides all of the buttons (they will reappear on reload)
